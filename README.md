# meamka:useraccounts-spectre

[Meteor](https://meteor.com) sign up and sign in templates (and much more!) styled for [Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/index.html)

This package depends on [useraccounts:core](https://atmospherejs.com/useraccounts/core)

Learn more [here](http://useraccounts.meteor.com) or have a look at the full [documentation](https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/core).


## Bring Your Own Spectre.css

Adding this package with `meteor add meamka:useraccounts-spectre` does not add any other packages providing Spectre.css. This is to let you choose the flavour you prefer, being it compiled, less, sass, or from CDN!

At the moment it is up to date with Spectre.css 0.4.5.
